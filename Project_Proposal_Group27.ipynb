    "\n",
    "Goals\n",
    "What are our team goals for this project?\n",
    "-> professor said most should do some type of regression so we can do things like how some variables are able to “predict” what the school’s ranking will be? \n",
    "\n",
    "What do we want to accomplish?\n",
    "-> maybe like predict ranking from other variables like number of international students\n",
    "\n",
    "What skills do we want to develop or refine?\n",
    "-> cleaning data, applying concepts in class like linear regression to real datasets, drawing conclusions, etc. \n",
    "-> Data Wangling: clean the data including identifying and handling the missing data, and scale the data to ensure that our data is normalized.\n",
    "->Data Exploration: create visualizations to explore the relations and patterns in our data, and compute the correlation(heat_map) to understand how they are related to each other to avoid the multicollinearity issue.\n",
    "-> Data Modeling: select the appropriate model like the interaction model or not.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Expectations\n",
    "What do we expect of one another regarding attendance at meetings, participation, frequency of communication, quality of work, etc.?\n",
    "-> be on time for meetings\n",
    "-> communicate through instagram consistently\n",
    "-> try to produce quality work without grammar mistakes\n",
    "-> Communicate updates and any relevant information consistently through team meetings.\n",
    "-> Active participation in all meetings and discussions to contribute their ideas and insights.\n",
    "Policies & Procedures\n",
    "What rules can we agree on to help us meet our goals and expectations?\n",
    "-> be prepared for meetings\n",
    "-> if unsure consult the other group members\n",
    "-> don’t gpt \n",
    "-> Respect diversity of opinions and backgrounds within the team\n",
    "->Provide regular feedback on individual and team performance\n",
    "\n",
    "Consequences:\n",
    "How will we address non-performance regarding these goals, expectations, policies and procedures?\n",
    "-> consult TA to address issues \n",
    "-> consult with the professor to solve issue\n",
    "\n",
    "Data:\n",
    "Decide with your team members a topic of interest you want to work on and identify a dataset to work with. Include a brief description of the dataset (2 or 3 sentences) and a link or reference on how to access the dataset. Note that in the next individual assignment you will be asked to fully describe the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "CHOSEN TOPIC/QUESTION:\n",
    "Which variables are most associated with Overall Score? Identify one or two variables which are associated (either positively or negatively) with Overall Score. Ensuring we identify and eliminate any variables with a high Variance Inflation Factor, as this would suggest multicollinearity.\n",

    "The dataset contains a ranking of 1,799 universities across the world. The dataset ranks universities on 6 performance indicators evaluating each university’s performance in topics such as research, industry income, and international outlook. \n",
